# basketbal-players-detections
this is the project for detecting 5 classes of objects inside basketball courts
# Introductions
<p align="justify"> detecting the basketball players is a chalening task due to the constant movements of the players and thier coalisions. The proposed methodology in this repository aims to tackle this issue wih proviidng a proper person, ball, rim,shots, man made object detetcions. The provided code has evaluate dtwo of teh best avilable models namely YOLO9 (e version) and YOLO11 (x versions). The model is trained via already avilable datasets.
